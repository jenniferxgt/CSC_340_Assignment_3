        <h1> About our Business</h1>
        <p> Mug Life is a business from Greensboro, North Carolina. We were founded by a student named Jennifer Galicia
        -Torres. Our founder realized that there are many mugs that end up being thrown away or donated. However, all
        of the mugs that our founder has ever seen, were unattractive. This is why our mission is to create meaningful
        , silly, funny, and visually aesthetic mugs for everyone! Everyone deserves a meaningful mug for whatever occasion.
        If you have any inquiries or inspiration for our future upcoming mug launch, please contact us at feedback@muglife.com
        </p>
